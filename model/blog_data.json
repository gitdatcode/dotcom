The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default.

In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.\\n\\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.\\n\\n==**News**, Cycling, #video==\\n\\nHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of `News`, and `Cycling` - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with `#video`.\\n\\nIn your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:\\n\\n```\\n{{#post}}\\n    {{#has tag=\\\"#video\\\"}}\\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\\n    {{else}}\\n        ...regular markup for a post...\\n    {{/has}}\\n{{/post}}\\n```\\n\\nYou can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive [theme documentation](https://themes.ghost.org/v1.23.0/).\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}",

Throughout the course steps, you'll know what you're learning, _why_ you're learning it, and what you code will be brought forward with you to subsequent steps -- in the end, you'll have something to show for your learning effort (like a web resume, or a portfolio site!).\\n\\nIn the beginning, our courses will be catered to beginner coders -- Code Newbies, if you will.

The community is made up of people all along the spectrum of coding\nknowledge, and making sure you get the most out of what DatCode has to offer is\nimportant. So with that, we thought it'd be a good idea to build a learning\ntool. For now, we'll call it Project Athena [http://athena.datcode.io].\n\nA Fresh Learning Experience\nProject Athena will pull in our efforts of compiling the best resources we can\nfind, with courses that are pointed and driven towards building things. Learning\ncode relies a lot on getting your hands dirty and opening up that text editor;\nwe think online courses should reflect that as well. Throughout the course\nsteps, you'll know what you're learning, why  you're learning it, and what you\ncode will be brought forward with you to subsequent steps -- in the end, you'll\nhave something to show for your learning effort (like a web resume, or a\nportfolio site!).\n\nIn the beginning, our courses will be catered to beginner coders -- Code\nNewbies, if you will. As the platform grows, and the coders along with it, it\nwill expand into more complex coding projects and concepts. We would like to\ncover a lot, but it's really all dependent upon what you want to learn. So let\nus know: what would you like to learn? What else do you think is missing from\nthe online learning experience? How can we help you on your coding journey?\n\nFeel free to contact us by email at hello@datcode.io, or tweet us @talkdatcode\n[http://twitter.com/talkdatcode]. We'll be happy to hear from you. And if you\nhaven't already, join us in the Slack group! (it's pretty lit ngl)\n\nHappy coding!",

I dug into the source and read all of it (this is definitely something you should do, we’ll talk about it later). I read it multiple times because I didn’t understand what it was doing, but I knew it worked.

Businesses realized that they MUST have a web presence, it wasn't optional. From this point forward, one could not be a web developer without having the ability to easily employ JavaScript to get their daily tasks done.\\n\\nIn 2009, [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) came on the scene. Node.js wasn’t the first server-side implementation of JavaScript but it was easily the most popular because it was built on Google's JavaScript engine, and didn't require the complications of the Java virtual machine. All of the web developers who were programming PHP, Ruby, Python, or Java on the server and JavaScript on the front-end saw a future where they could write-once, run-everywhere. JavaScript gave that to them.\\n\\nIn 2013, Facebook released a library called [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library), which moved everything needed to render a webpage into a JavaScript function. React is fast, efficient, and most importantly, allows developers to build and deliver quickly. React also allows web developers to use the tools and techniques that they are most familiar with to enter into native app development on both iOS and Android.\\n\\nThe JavaScript language is evolving daily, as are its tools and capabilities. Today JavaScript can do more than ever and developers and companies big and small see it as a means to get real work done.\\n\\n##The Community is HUGE\\n\\nToday JavaScript is the 8th most popular language on the [TIOBE index](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), 1st in [StackOverflow’s developer survey](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016) since 2013, and is [GitHub's](https://github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github) most popular language since 2012. Actually, describing the JavaScript community as huge is an understatement: it is probably the biggest of any programming language on the planet and there are no signs of that trend changing.\\n\\nJavaScript is not only easy to get into, ultimately understand and become very proficient with, but has proven to be a powerful tool used to solve real-world problems.\\n\\n##The Future is Bright\\n\\nPick a popular language and I'm certain that it has a transpiler that outputs JavaScript. Companies like Microsoft, who have historically attempted to obstruct the web's growth, have fully embraced standard JavaScript and have made it a first-class citizen in its operating systems. Google, the largest player on the internet, use JavaScript to make their products and services available to anyone on the planet. Google is often first to adopt the latest technological advances in the JavaScript langue and push them out first to their world-class Chrome browser. Apple, typically seen as 'the walled garden' company, has a substantial investment in the WebKit project, which has been used as the foundation for countless projects helping move the web and JavaScript forward.\\n\\nWith the continued growth of, and dependence on, the internet, the world will demand more and more developers who know and understand JavaScript. Since the advent of smartphone, user engagement shifted to native applications, as the technology for web rich web experiences wasn't there.

                "plaintext": "You should learn JavaScript.\n\nNo, you really should. If you’re reading this, you probably have an interest in\nsoftware development, and have access to a computer with a web browser - which\nmeans that you already have all of the tools necessary to learn and build things\nwith JavaScript.\n\nJavaScript is everywhere and it is doing a lot of things: from making websites\ninteractive and a joy to use, to powering the brains for robots, you will even\nfind that it is used to build desktop and mobile applications.\n\nLearning JavaScript could be the catalyst for launching a full-fledged career as\na software developer, or it could allow you to hold your own when it comes to\nleading a team. No matter what your software development goal is, learning\nJavaScript will help you get there easier.\n\nJavaScript is Ubiquitous\nJavaScript is the most widely-available programming language in the world. It is\nincluded, one way or another, in just about every browser shipped in every\ntablet, (smart)phone, and computer. As the web became more important around the\nturn of the century, having an dynamic way to interact with static pages changed\nfrom a want to a must.\n\nHow We Got Here\nAround 2005/2006 was the introduction of AJAX\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)], made popular by Google’s new\nemail service, Gmail, and the introduction of Prototype.js\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_JavaScript_Framework].\n\nI got hired for a job simply because I was able to refresh portions of the page\ncontent without reloading the page, using a Microsoft invention called\nXMLHttpRequest (colloquially AJAX). I also recall the day someone posted about\nPrototype.js, and my whole world changed. Commands that worked in one browser,\nbut were slightly buggy in another, were now wrapped up behind dollar signs. I\ndug into the source and read all of it (this is definitely something you should\ndo, we’ll talk about it later). I read it multiple times because I didn’t\nunderstand what it was doing, but I knew it worked. Overnight the little obscure\nlanguage that didn't quite make much sense changed into something that real\napplications could be built with.\n\nWith the availability of inexpensive computers, the growth of consumer\nbroadband, and the advancements made in the JavaScript language and its tooling,\nthe web was solidified as a viable development platform. Businesses realized\nthat they MUST have a web presence, it wasn't optional. From this point forward,\none could not be a web developer without having the ability to easily employ\nJavaScript to get their daily tasks done.\n\nIn 2009, Node.js [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js]  came on the scene.\nNode.js wasn’t the first server-side implementation of JavaScript but it was\neasily the most popular because it was built on Google's JavaScript engine, and\ndidn't require the complications of the Java virtual machine. All of the web\ndevelopers who were programming PHP, Ruby, Python, or Java on the server and\nJavaScript on the front-end saw a future where they could write-once,\nrun-everywhere. JavaScript gave that to them.\n\nIn 2013, Facebook released a library called [React](\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library), which moved everything\nneeded to render a webpage into a JavaScript function. React is fast, efficient,\nand most importantly, allows developers to build and deliver quickly. React also\nallows web developers to use the tools and techniques that they are most\nfamiliar with to enter into native app development on both iOS and Android.\n\nThe JavaScript language is evolving daily, as are its tools and capabilities.\nToday JavaScript can do more than ever and developers and companies big and\nsmall see it as a means to get real work done.\n\nThe Community is HUGE\nToday JavaScript is the 8th most popular language on the TIOBE index\n[http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/], 1st in StackOverflow’s developer survey\n[http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016]  since 2013, and is \nGitHub's [https://github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github]  most popular\nlanguage since 2012. Actually, describing the JavaScript community as huge is an\nunderstatement: it is probably the biggest of any programming language on the\nplanet and there are no signs of that trend changing.\n\nJavaScript is not only easy to get into, ultimately understand and become very\nproficient with, but has proven to be a powerful tool used to solve real-world\nproblems.\n\nThe Future is Bright\nPick a popular language and I'm certain that it has a transpiler that outputs\nJavaScript. Companies like Microsoft, who have historically attempted to\nobstruct the web's growth, have fully embraced standard JavaScript and have made\nit a first-class citizen in its operating systems. Google, the largest player on\nthe internet, use JavaScript to make their products and services available to\nanyone on the planet. Google is often first to adopt the latest technological\nadvances in the JavaScript langue and push them out first to their world-class\nChrome browser. Apple, typically seen as 'the walled garden' company, has a\nsubstantial investment in the WebKit project, which has been used as the\nfoundation for countless projects helping move the web and JavaScript forward.\n\nWith the continued growth of, and dependence on, the internet, the world will\ndemand more and more developers who know and understand JavaScript. Since the\nadvent of smartphone, user engagement shifted to native applications, as the\ntechnology for web rich web experiences wasn't there. Now that it is, with the\nhelp of JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, the most accessible piece of software has\nnew life again. There' no better time than now to earn how to build with\nJavaScript.\n\nWhere To Start\n * Codecademy JavaScript course [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript]\n * JavaScript basics by Mozilla\n   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHave you joined yet?

Just about everything in JavaScript is an `object`; or a different way to explain it, is that `Object` (big O) is the parent of just about everything. An object is simply **a collection of variables, functions, and other objects**. \\n\\nWhen you read the word `object`, I want you to think of these characters: `{}`. Let's try it: Object. Did you think `{}`? Good.\\n\\n> All JavaScripts objects have a parent (or Prototype, is the technical term) which provides them with some core functionality. The `Number` parent prototype offers functions like `toPrecision` or `toExponential`.  A `String` has functions like `split` or `indexOf` and so on. \\n\\n> So in thinking of an object`{}`, always know that its prototype adds some properties and functions to it behind the scenes. And since all objects extend `Object`, there are common properties and functions found on all JavaScript objects.\\n\\nMake sense? Let's pull out a diagram:\\n\\n![what even are objects](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9299425/blog%20assets/an%20object.jpg)\\n\\nSimple enough, right? Let's get into scopes.\\n\\n###Globals and Scoping\\n\\nNow that you know what JavaScript objects are, we can talk about scope. Every JavaScript environment has a global object that is available everywhere. In the browser it is the `window` object; or in Node.js, it is the aptly titled `GLOBAL`. So, again, think of that global object like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nwindow = {};\\n```\\n\\nWhen you define things in JavaScript -- a variable, a function, an object, etc. -- it is typically made apart of the object that it was declared in. Now this has a few exceptions: the most notorious, and the thing that will cause silent and hard to trace errors, are variables. \\n\\nYou can think of defining variables as assigning it (`binding`) to an object:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar name = 'mark';\\n```\\n\\nIs like saying:\\n\\n```javascript\\nwindow.name = 'mark';\\n```\\n(Because the object we're working in is `window`). Now say we wanted to create a new object:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar your_object = {};\\n```\\n\\nFollowing this logic, `your_object` that we defined above is basically `window.your_object`. Makes sense? \\n\\n\\n\\n> You have to be careful with variable definitions. If you don't put a `var` (or `let` or `const`) in front of a variable, that definition would float up and be assigned to the global object. That could cause some nasty problems, right? Always keep this in mind.\\n\\n\\n###Functions are a bit different...\\n\\nA function is an object, and has scope; however, once you call a function, it is used and disposed of. You no longer have access to the function itself, only the returned value.\\n\\n```javascript\\nfunction whatIsThis(){\\n    console.log(this);\\n}\\n\\nwhatIsThis(); // window{}\\n```\\n\\nIn the example above, the `whatIsThis` function will simply write the value of `this` to the console when executed. In this case, `this` is the `window` object - because  `whatIsThis` is bound to its scope.\\n\\nBut, if you were to use the `new` keyword:\\n\\n```javascript\\nnew whatIsThis(); //whatIsThis{}\\n```\\nIt's now acting as a template; and since it's a template, instead of writing to the console like before... it returns an object! And now, `this` is the new object `whatIsThis{}`. Psh, that's so easy.\\n\\nNow, what if we put a function in an object?\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar some_object = {\\n    'whatIsThis' : function(){\\n        console.log(this);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nCalling `some_object.whatIsThis();` will write `some_object{whatIsThis: function}` to the console - because in this case, the `whatIsThis` function is bound to the scope of `some_object`.\\n\\nTake a look at the object below and try to figure out what is written to the console when:\\n\\n1. you call `some_object.whatIsThis()`\\n1. you call `some_object.another_object.nowWhatIsThis()`\\n1. you call `new some_object.another_object.nowWhatIsThis()`\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar some_object = {\\n    'whatIsThis' : function(){\\n        console.log(this);\\n    },\\n    'another_object' : {\\n        'nowWhatIsThis': function(){\\n            console.log(this);\\n        }\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n> **Answers**\\n\\n> 1. `some_object{whatIsThis: function, other_object: > Object}` -- the `some_object` object\\n> 1. `{nowWhatIsThis: function}` -- the `some_object.another_object` object\\n> 1. `nowWhatIsThis{}` -- a new object that used the `some_object.another_object.nowWhatIsThis` function as a template\\n\\nDid you get 'em right?\\n\\nThe main takeaway is that `this` is the closest parent object `{}` of where your function is being executed. If that function is called with the `new` keyword, `this` is the newly created object.\\n\\n## Augmenting `this`\\n\\nSince just about everything in JavaScript is an object, just about everything in JavaScript has potential to be the value of `this`. The most common example for web developers will be adding event handlers to objects returned from the `DOM`.\\n\\n> The DOM (Document Object Model) is a virtual representation of your markup (HTML) that JavaScript has access to.\\n\\n### Event Handlers\\n\\nLets say you have a link on a webpage that you want to add a click event to, it would look something like this:\\n\\n```\\n<a href=\\\"#\\\" id=\\\"my_link\\\">My Link</a>\\n....\\nvar my_link = document.getElementById('my_link');\\nmy_link.onclick = function(){\\n    console.log(this);\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThe code simply:\\n\\n1. grabs the link from the `DOM` and assigns it to a variable.\\n1. defines an `onclick` event on that variable as a function, which writes the value of `this` to the console\\n\\nWhat do you think is the value of `this` in this scenario? The answer shouldn't surprise you - \\\"just about everything in JavaScript is an object.\\\" \\n\\nThat variable `my_link`, when we ran `document.getElementById`? It was assigned an object: `my_link{}`. When we create the `onclick` function, it's being attached _to_ that object. Now remember above when we executed `some_object.whatIsThis()` and found out that `this` was `some_object`? In this example, `this` is the hyperlink object! If you were to click the link, what you'd see in the console is `<a href=\\\"#\\\" id=\\\"my_link\\\">My Link</a>` (clicking the link is telling the browser to execute `my_link.onclick(DOMEvent)`, which would execute `console.log`).\\n\\n> You should not add event handlers this way, I did this to help illustrate how functions are added to our imaginary object`{}`. Use [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener).\\n\\n###Changing `this` at execution time\\n\\nJavaScript is a neat little language. There are tons of little things you can do with it that isn't possible in most other languages that you come across. One of those things is changing `this` whenever you want to. This can be done in a number of ways, but we'll take a look at `call` and `apply`.\\n\\n> Both `call` and `apply` do the same thing -- change the meaning of `this` in the function -- but do it a bit differently. `call` will allow you to pass a number of comma separated arguments to the function, while `apply` requires the arguments to be in an array. Each approach has its benefits.\\n\\nLets say we have this object `my_object` as defined below. When we call `my_object.fullName()` it would write \\\"Mark Henderson\\\" to the console. \\n\\n```javascript\\nvar my_object = {\\n    'f_name': 'Mark',\\n    'l_name': 'Henderson',\\n\\n    'fullName': function(){\\n        return this.f_name + ' ' + this.l_name;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nBut what if you needed to write some other name to the console? You could define another object with a `fullName` method, you could augment the signature of `my_object.fullName` to pass in a first and last name, or you can do something cool using JavaScript the way it was intended.\\n\\nLooking at that `fullName` function, it looks like it only needs an object with `f_name` and `l_name` defined.\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar jermaine_object = {\\n    'f_name': \\\"Jer'Maine\\\",\\n    'l_name': \\\"Fincher\\\"\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThat looks good, but how do I replace the `this` in that `fullName` function? Use either `call` or `apply`:\\n\\n```javascript\\nmy_object.fullName.call(jermaine_object);\\n```\\n\\nRunning that code will write \\\"Jer'Maine Fincher\\\" to the console. \\n\\nWoah, woah, what?\\n\\nI know, let me explain. It all goes back to \\\"just about everything in JavaScript is an object,\\\" and we know that functions are no different. Think of a function as an executable object`{}`: we know that objects can have variables and functions bound to it. In this case we, are simply using the `call` function that is bound to the `fullName` function. If we could take a special look at the structure of `my_object`, it would look something like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nmy_object<Object>{\\n    f_name<Object>,\\n    l_name<Object>,\\n\\n    fullName<Function>{\\n        call<Function>,\\n        apply<Function>,\\n        name<String>,\\n        arguments<Array-Like-Object>,\\n        ...\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf we executed `console.log(my_object.fullName.name)` it would write \\\"fullName\\\" to the console. We can treat the `fullName` function like any other JavaScript object (but only _before_ we execute the function, with parenthesis `()` at the end of it).\\n\\nSo what does `my_object.fullName.call(jermaine_object);` do? It simply runs the `call` function on the `fullName` function. What does `call` do? Like `apply`, it simply redefines what `this` represents in the function, and calls it. It does not _permanently_ redefine `this`, but only changes while the `call` function is running. \\n\\nSince we know that `this` represents the object that that the function is scoped to, calling `my_object.fullName();` can be thought of like:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar my_object = {\\n    ...\\n    'fullName': function(){\\n        return my_object.f_name + ' ' + my_object.l_name;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n(I replaced `this` with `my_object`)\\n\\nSo calling `my_object.fullName.call(jermaine_object);`, where `call` replaces `this`, can be thought of as:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar my_object = {\\n    ...\\n    'fullName': function(){\\n        return jermaine_object.f_name + ' ' + jermaine_object.l_name;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n(`jermaine_object` is the new `this`, but only for the one time)\\n\\n##Next Steps\\n\\nUnderstanding what `this` is and keeping track of when it potentially changes could be an exercise in itself. There are a lot of ways to change what `this` means: `Function.call`, `Function.apply`, `Function.bind` (this is a good one as it doesn't execute the function immediately, but creates a new one to be executed), `Object.addEventHandler`, and so on.\\n\\nThere are tons of resources online that will help you better understand `this`, but the best one is to practice. Write some code, use `this` in your code (don't be scared), and the keyword will naturally become an integral part of your JavaScript toolkit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n_[Have you joined yet?](http://blog.datcode.io/join-datcode/) What are you waiting for?!

An object is simply a collection of variables, functions, and other\nobjects.\n\nWhen you read the word object, I want you to think of these characters: {}.\nLet's try it: Object. Did you think {}? Good.\n\nAll JavaScripts objects have a parent (or Prototype, is the technical term)\nwhich provides them with some core functionality. The Number  parent prototype\noffers functions like toPrecision  or toExponential. A String  has functions\nlike split  or indexOf  and so on.\n\nSo in thinking of an object{}, always know that its prototype adds some\nproperties and functions to it behind the scenes. And since all objects extend \nObject, there are common properties and functions found on all JavaScript\nobjects.\n\nMake sense? Let's pull out a diagram:\n\n\n\nSimple enough, right? Let's get into scopes.\n\nGlobals and Scoping\nNow that you know what JavaScript objects are, we can talk about scope. Every\nJavaScript environment has a global object that is available everywhere. In the\nbrowser it is the window  object; or in Node.js, it is the aptly titled GLOBAL.\nSo, again, think of that global object like this:\n\nwindow = {};\n\n\nWhen you define things in JavaScript -- a variable, a function, an object, etc.\n-- it is typically made apart of the object that it was declared in. Now this\nhas a few exceptions: the most notorious, and the thing that will cause silent\nand hard to trace errors, are variables.\n\nYou can think of defining variables as assigning it (binding) to an object:\n\nvar name = 'mark';\n\n\nIs like saying:\n\nwindow.name = 'mark';\n\n\n(Because the object we're working in is window). Now say we wanted to create a\nnew object:\n\nvar your_object = {};\n\n\nFollowing this logic, your_object  that we defined above is basically \nwindow.your_object. Makes sense?\n\nYou have to be careful with variable definitions. If you don't put a var  (or \nlet  or const) in front of a variable, that definition would float up and be\nassigned to the global object. That could cause some nasty problems, right?\nAlways keep this in mind.\n\nFunctions are a bit different...\nA function is an object, and has scope; however, once you call a function, it is\nused and disposed of. You no longer have access to the function itself, only the\nreturned value.\n\nfunction whatIsThis(){\n    console.log(this);\n}\n\nwhatIsThis(); // window{}\n\n\nIn the example above, the whatIsThis  function will simply write the value of \nthis  to the console when executed. In this case, this  is the window  object -\nbecause whatIsThis  is bound to its scope.\n\nBut, if you were to use the new  keyword:\n\nnew whatIsThis(); //whatIsThis{}\n\n\nIt's now acting as a template; and since it's a template, instead of writing to\nthe console like before... it returns an object! And now, this  is the new\nobject whatIsThis{}. Psh, that's so easy.\n\nNow, what if we put a function in an object?\n\nvar some_object = {\n    'whatIsThis' : function(){\n        console.log(this);\n    }\n};\n\n\nCalling some_object.whatIsThis();  will write some_object{whatIsThis: function} \nto the console - because in this case, the whatIsThis  function is bound to the\nscope of some_object.\n\nTake a look at the object below and try to figure out what is written to the\nconsole when:\n\n 1. you call some_object.whatIsThis()\n 2. you call some_object.another_object.nowWhatIsThis()\n 3. you call new some_object.another_object.nowWhatIsThis()\n\nvar some_object = {\n    'whatIsThis' : function(){\n        console.log(this);\n    },\n    'another_object' : {\n        'nowWhatIsThis': function(){\n            console.log(this);\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n\nAnswers\n\n 1. some_object{whatIsThis: function, other_object: > Object}  -- the \n    some_object  object\n 2. {nowWhatIsThis: function}  -- the some_object.another_object  object\n 3. nowWhatIsThis{}  -- a new object that used the \n    some_object.another_object.nowWhatIsThis  function as a template\n\nDid you get 'em right?\n\nThe main takeaway is that this  is the closest parent object {}  of where your\nfunction is being executed. If that function is called with the new  keyword, \nthis  is the newly created object.\n\nAugmenting this\nSince just about everything in JavaScript is an object, just about everything in\nJavaScript has potential to be the value of this. The most common example for\nweb developers will be adding event handlers to objects returned from the DOM.\n\nThe DOM (Document Object Model) is a virtual representation of your markup\n(HTML) that JavaScript has access to.\n\nEvent Handlers\nLets say you have a link on a webpage that you want to add a click event to, it\nwould look something like this:\n\n<a href=\"#\" id=\"my_link\">My Link</a>\n....\nvar my_link = document.getElementById('my_link');\nmy_link.onclick = function(){\n    console.log(this);\n};\n\n\nThe code simply:\n\n 1. grabs the link from the DOM  and assigns it to a variable.\n 2. defines an onclick  event on that variable as a function, which writes the\n    value of this  to the console\n\nWhat do you think is the value of this  in this scenario? The answer shouldn't\nsurprise you - \"just about everything in JavaScript is an object.\"\n\nThat variable my_link, when we ran document.getElementById? It was assigned an\nobject: my_link{}. When we create the onclick  function, it's being attached to \nthat object. Now remember above when we executed some_object.whatIsThis()  and\nfound out that this  was some_object? In this example, this  is the hyperlink\nobject! If you were to click the link, what you'd see in the console is <a\nhref=\"#\" id=\"my_link\">My Link</a>  (clicking the link is telling the browser to\nexecute my_link.onclick(DOMEvent), which would execute console.log).\n\nYou should not add event handlers this way, I did this to help illustrate how\nfunctions are added to our imaginary object{}. Use addEventListener\n[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener].\n\nChanging this  at execution time\nJavaScript is a neat little language. There are tons of little things you can do\nwith it that isn't possible in most other languages that you come across. One of\nthose things is changing this  whenever you want to. This can be done in a\nnumber of ways, but we'll take a look at call  and apply.\n\nBoth call  and apply  do the same thing -- change the meaning of this  in the\nfunction -- but do it a bit differently. call  will allow you to pass a number\nof comma separated arguments to the function, while apply  requires the\narguments to be in an array. Each approach has its benefits.\n\nLets say we have this object my_object  as defined below. When we call \nmy_object.fullName()  it would write \"Mark Henderson\" to the console.\n\nvar my_object = {\n    'f_name': 'Mark',\n    'l_name': 'Henderson',\n\n    'fullName': function(){\n        return this.f_name + ' ' + this.l_name;\n    }\n};\n\n\nBut what if you needed to write some other name to the console? You could define\nanother object with a fullName  method, you could augment the signature of \nmy_object.fullName  to pass in a first and last name, or you can do something\ncool using JavaScript the way it was intended.\n\nLooking at that fullName  function, it looks like it only needs an object with \nf_name  and l_name  defined.\n\nvar jermaine_object = {\n    'f_name': \"Jer'Maine\",\n    'l_name': \"Fincher\"\n};\n\n\nThat looks good, but how do I replace the this  in that fullName  function? Use\neither call  or apply:\n\nmy_object.fullName.call(jermaine_object);\n\n\nRunning that code will write \"Jer'Maine Fincher\" to the console.\n\nWoah, woah, what?\n\nI know, let me explain. It all goes back to \"just about everything in JavaScript\nis an object,\" and we know that functions are no different. Think of a function\nas an executable object{}: we know that objects can have variables and functions\nbound to it. In this case we, are simply using the call  function that is bound\nto the fullName  function. If we could take a special look at the structure of \nmy_object, it would look something like this:\n\nmy_object<Object>{\n    f_name<Object>,\n    l_name<Object>,\n\n    fullName<Function>{\n        call<Function>,\n        apply<Function>,\n        name<String>,\n        arguments<Array-Like-Object>,\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\nIf we executed console.log(my_object.fullName.name)  it would write \"fullName\"\nto the console. We can treat the fullName  function like any other JavaScript\nobject (but only before  we execute the function, with parenthesis ()  at the\nend of it).\n\nSo what does my_object.fullName.call(jermaine_object);  do? It simply runs the \ncall  function on the fullName  function. What does call  do? Like apply, it\nsimply redefines what this  represents in the function, and calls it. It does\nnot permanently  redefine this, but only changes while the call  function is\nrunning.\n\nSince we know that this  represents the object that that the function is scoped\nto, calling my_object.fullName();  can be thought of like:\n\nvar my_object = {\n    ...\n    'fullName': function(){\n        return my_object.f_name + ' ' + my_object.l_name;\n    }\n};\n\n\n(I replaced this  with my_object)\n\nSo calling my_object.fullName.call(jermaine_object);, where call  replaces this,\ncan be thought of as:\n\nvar my_object = {\n    ...\n    'fullName': function(){\n        return jermaine_object.f_name + ' ' + jermaine_object.l_name;\n    }\n};\n\n\n(jermaine_object  is the new this, but only for the one time)\n\nNext Steps\nUnderstanding what this  is and keeping track of when it potentially changes\ncould be an exercise in itself. There are a lot of ways to change what this \nmeans: Function.call, Function.apply, Function.bind  (this is a good one as it\ndoesn't execute the function immediately, but creates a new one to be executed),\n Object.addEventHandler, and so on.\n\nThere are tons of resources online that will help you better understand this,\nbut the best one is to practice. Write some code, use this  in your code (don't\nbe scared), and the keyword will naturally become an integral part of your\nJavaScript toolkit.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHave you joined yet?

Things like package managers, preprocessors (like [SASS](http://sass-lang.org) or [LESS](http://lesscss.org) for writing CSS). One important tool at your disposal is called [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), or a code management system.\\n\\nAs the name implies, **version control systems (VCS)** manage any changes you make to your code. You create an initial code base, or **repository**, and when you save your changes, the VCS keeps track of every little thing you modified. This is especially important for large projects with a bunch of developers working on it, but individual developers can make use of them too, as a means of documenting where and when you made changes if something goes wrong.\\n\\n##Git... like \\\"get\\\"?\\nOne of the more popular VCS you'll come across is [Git](http://git-scm.com). It's an open-source, distributed version control system, created by Linus Torvalds of [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) fame. If you're wondering about [the name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#History)...\\n> Torvalds quipped about the name git (which means unpleasant person in British English slang): \\\"I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself.

Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.\\n> - \\\"g-dd-mn idiotic truckload of sh*t\\\": when it breaks\\n\\nYou can take your pick.\\n\\nLinus created Git because the system they were using at the time was very slow - taking up to 30 seconds to make changes to the codebase. So he went with Git being a [_distributed_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control) system, rather than centralized. A few key things:\\n\\n - by its namesake, a distributed system doesn't have a central, reference copy of code that you're making changes to. There's only working copies, meaning every developer has their own copy of the source.\\n - any operations that you make - **commit** code, view the change history, reverting any changes - is fast, because there's no server to communicate with; it's all done on your working copy.\\n - each working copy is pretty much a remote backup; it'll track _all_ of the change-history, so if your codebase gets lost, you still have it.\\n\\nThis may or may not be easy to understand. Let me draw a little diagram for you.\\n\\n![How Git Works](http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9299425/blog%20assets/how%20git%20works.jpg)\\n\\nMake sense? It might be clearer once you start using it. One way you might use it is to divvy up any new components or services you may be adding to an app or website - creating what are called **branches** on your remote copy. That way, you can bounce between them and you're not just working them all in one, keeping track of where you are on each. When you're done, you just **merge** the branch back into your main code.\\n\\n##So what is Git_Hub_?\\nYou actually may have heard of [GitHub](http://github.com) before you even knew or understood what Git was. Basically, GitHub is your server. It's a web service built on Git where you can keep all of your source code; and since it's built on Git, you're able to see all the changes to the repository right in the browser. It also makes collaborating with other developers much easier, like keeping track of known issues and pull requests. \\n\\nWhat's more, GitHub is also a social network. You can have a look at all the members and their public repositories, and even use some of them yourself in your own projects. A lot of businesses use GitHub as well, from Google to Microsoft, for their open-source projects. Another thing you'll see on user profiles are contributions they may have made to GitHub projects - it keeps track of that. So maybe you find a bug while you're using it: you can make a pull request once you've fixed it, and the owner of the repository can have a look at it, committing the changes to the source if everything checks out. It's pretty cool, and a good way to get your hands dirty. Did I mention it's free to sign up? \\n\\nUsing Git can be a bit confusing at first, but once you've got the hang of it, it'll be invaluable once you start to work on bigger and more complex projects. If you're job hunting, knowledge of version control is usually required - they may even name Git specifically. And GitHub, with its vast community and projects, will be a good resource for finding something you need for your own project, or just to play around with.

Take your pick from the\n   dictionary of slang.\n * \"global information tracker\": you're in a good mood, and it actually\n   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.\n * \"g-dd-mn idiotic truckload of sh*t\": when it breaks\n\nYou can take your pick.\n\nLinus created Git because the system they were using at the time was very slow -\ntaking up to 30 seconds to make changes to the codebase. So he went with Git\nbeing a distributed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control] \nsystem, rather than centralized. A few key things:\n\n * by its namesake, a distributed system doesn't have a central, reference copy\n   of code that you're making changes to. There's only working copies, meaning\n   every developer has their own copy of the source.\n * any operations that you make - commit  code, view the change history,\n   reverting any changes - is fast, because there's no server to communicate\n   with; it's all done on your working copy.\n * each working copy is pretty much a remote backup; it'll track all  of the\n   change-history, so if your codebase gets lost, you still have it.\n\nThis may or may not be easy to understand. Let me draw a little diagram for you.\n\n\n\nMake sense? It might be clearer once you start using it. One way you might use\nit is to divvy up any new components or services you may be adding to an app or\nwebsite - creating what are called branches  on your remote copy. That way, you\ncan bounce between them and you're not just working them all in one, keeping\ntrack of where you are on each. When you're done, you just merge  the branch\nback into your main code.\n\nSo what is Git_Hub_?\nYou actually may have heard of GitHub [http://github.com]  before you even knew\nor understood what Git was. Basically, GitHub is your server. It's a web service\nbuilt on Git where you can keep all of your source code; and since it's built on\nGit, you're able to see all the changes to the repository right in the browser.\nIt also makes collaborating with other developers much easier, like keeping\ntrack of known issues and pull requests.\n\nWhat's more, GitHub is also a social network. You can have a look at all the\nmembers and their public repositories, and even use some of them yourself in\nyour own projects. A lot of businesses use GitHub as well, from Google to\nMicrosoft, for their open-source projects. Another thing you'll see on user\nprofiles are contributions they may have made to GitHub projects - it keeps\ntrack of that. So maybe you find a bug while you're using it: you can make a\npull request once you've fixed it, and the owner of the repository can have a\nlook at it, committing the changes to the source if everything checks out. It's\npretty cool, and a good way to get your hands dirty. Did I mention it's free to\nsign up?\n\nUsing Git can be a bit confusing at first, but once you've got the hang of it,\nit'll be invaluable once you start to work on bigger and more complex projects.\nIf you're job hunting, knowledge of version control is usually required - they\nmay even name Git specifically. And GitHub, with its vast community and\nprojects, will be a good resource for finding something you need for your own\nproject, or just to play around with. You'll love it.\n\nWhere do I start with Git?\nCheck out the Git website [http://git-scm.com]  to look at the documentation,\nand get an in-depth look at how Git works. At tryGit\n[https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1], you can go through some\nchallenges learning how to use Git from the command line interface. GitHub also\nhas a list of resources\n[https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/] \nto get you started. And as always, Google is your friend. If you find something\ngood, you should share it to #DatCode [http://twitter.com/search/datcode]!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHave you joined yet?

Sometimes those online\nacquaintances become friends IRL.\n\nAttending meetups, events, conferences and hackathons is a surefire way to meet\nmore people in tech and make friends. If you're not volunteering, definitely aim\nto be participating. I attended my first hackathon a few weeks ago and connected\nwith a teammate, who after the hackathon said she would be happy to continue\nhelping me build out my app idea. Need I say more?!\n\n\"Strive to make the tech industry more inclusive and accepting of everyone.\"\nThis is the goal. Tech literally touches everything, thus we are all affected by\nit. It's only right that all  of us have a part in the 'how' of technology. When\nyou have an inclusive mindset and the output to match, you will happen along\nlike-minded individuals, and great things are bound to happen.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHave you joined yet?
